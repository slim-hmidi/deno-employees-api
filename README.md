# deno-employees-api
This is a simple demo for a basic api built with deno and basic deno framework called abc.

# start server
```
deno run --allow-write --allow-read --allow-plugin --allow-net --allow-env --unstable ./server.ts

```

## PS:
I use deno v1.0.0 to run the server, if you are using a new version of deno and the app does not work, feel free to open an issue on my repository or the module's repository which generates the error.
